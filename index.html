        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>It all started in a shipyard in 1878, with Shozo Kawasaki
          Today, KAWASAKI HEAVY INDUSTRIES is a large, global organization that operates in many markets and is always at the forefront of cutting-edge technologies.
          
          The production of complete motorcycles began more than 50 years ago. Our very first engine was designed based on the technical knowledge gained from the development and design of aircraft engines.
          We started producing motorcycles with one fixed goal in mind: to develop new techniques. Over the years, we have introduced a large number of models that changed the entire motorcycle world. At the same time, we made legendary motorcycles, many of which are still etched in everyone's memory, mainly because of the (at the time) astonishing power and unprecedented speed. In 1996, we passed the 10 million engine mark, a testament to our diverse range and an encouragement to continue developing legendary engines.
